            <p>Our daughter, <span>Nina Samsonowicz</span>, was born on July 12, 2016 in Cracow with one of the most
                severe congenital heart defects – <span>HLHS (hypoplastic left heart syndrome)</span>, which in simple
                words means that
                fate gave her only <span>half a heart</span>.</p>
            <p>Nina's life depends on at least <span>3 extremely complex and risky surgeries. </span>Unfortunately,
                despite that our
                daughter’s heart will never be healthy. One ventricle will have to last her for life awaiting new
                medical solutions. Nina has already undergone 2 serious open-heart surgeries that has brought her to
                death's door on a few occasions.</p>
            <p>She needs one more surgery, which we would like to be carried out in <span>Germany at the University
                    Hospital
                    in Münster (UKM)</span>, where outstanding results in children with single vetricle hearts are
                achieved. We've
                already got reffered to the medical treatment in the UKM. The cost of surgery and care is <span>37 000
                    Euro.
                    We have already gathered around 1/3 of this amount.</span> You can help us achieve this goal by

            <h3>Get to know our story</h3>
            <p><span>We discovered that our baby is going to have a heart defect during the pregnancy.</span> On
                February 22, 2016
                during the pregnancy ultrasound we heard that our child’s heart was not working properly. 4 days later
                we did a prenatal echocardiogram. We heard the words all parents are extremely afraid of: Your child is
                seriously ill. And then – further blows. The diagnosis: a critical defect – HLHS – hypoplastic left
                heart syndrome. A three-stage cardiosurgical treatment. It is impossible to restore the heart's normal
                anatomy, it will always remain a single ventricle heart. The child has no chance of survival without a
                surgery immediately after birth. Such operations are very risky and many children don’t make it
                through. Suddenly, we had to get used to the idea that what we took for granted, like the fact that our
                daughter will one day graduate from high school, go to college, get a job, have children, is not really
                that certain. Yet we did not expect at the time what terrible moments we were going to go through and
                how many dangers were awaiting us. Thus began the battle and the race for the life and health of our
                daughter, Nina. Over a month before the birth of our daughter we moved to Cracow to be able to treat
                her in the Children's University Hospital in Prokocim. We did not realize that on and off we would
                spend in Cracow a total of six months.</p>
            <img src="assets/img/img_01.jpg" alt="">
            <p><span>Nina was born on time in spite of predictions that her delivery would be premature.</span> But she
                was a tiny child – weighing only 2.5kg (5.5lb). Immediately after birth, instead in her mother’s arms
                she was put in a hospital cot which became her home for the first three months of her life. She had her
                first life-saving operation at the age of 2 weeks. Nina struggled with the radical changes which had to
                be made in her body – her recovery from the surgery was long and slow. Her low birth weight made it
                difficult for her to fight for her life. For almost one and a half months she was mechanically assisted
                by a breathing ventilator and then by a CPAP device. Practically, during her entire hospital stay Nina
                was fed through an NG tube, and at some point only parenterally, because any attempt to feed her ended
                up with vomiting. Due to her anaemia, she underwent a blood transfusion. She had to endure invasive
                lungs examination, pleural fluid draining, countless punctures and other painful treatments. Despite
                the ordeal our daughter had to go through, her condition on discharge from hospital was good. Over the
                next weeks we could enjoy a nearly normal life at home. </p>
            <img src="assets/img/img_02.jpg" alt="">
            <p><span>Nina’s second operation took place as planned on January 17, 2017.</span> Unfortunately, also this
                time our daughter had to fight a tough battle for her life. On the second day after the surgery Nina
                had to undergo urgent cardiac catheterization due to a threatening blood clot, which deposited itself
                in the left pulmonary artery, followed then by aggressive medical treatment. Fortunately, doctors’
                reaction was immediate and Nina’s condition improved and gradually reached stability. Nina had to fight
                with heavy bleeding from her nose (which resulted in the need to introduce breathing tube through the
                mouth and administer muscle relaxant medication for several days), painful sores from plasters, fever
                that lasted for days, residue in the stomach, and eventually a rotavirus infection, until she was
                finally able to go home a month later.</p>
            <img src="assets/img/img_03.jpg" alt="">
            <p><span>It was a very difficult time, although we experienced it differently than after the first
                    operation.</span>
                We already got to know Nina and watching her in serious condition, swollen and feverish, was difficult
                to bear. We were worried about her further development. The tiny Nina at 7 months old weighed only 5 kg
                and was exhausted by the hospital stay. Fortunately, she quickly recovered and we timidly started to
                open up to normal life that we knew from before the diagnosis.</p>
            <img src="assets/img/img_04.jpg" alt="">
            <p><span>Despite her difficult taking off, Nina managed to catch up with her healthy peers.</span> At first
                glance, compared to other children of her age she is “only” extremely underweight. At the age of almost
                2.5 years she weighs a little more than 9kg (19.8lbs). Initially we were afraid whether she’d be able
                to walk, and she can now run and dance, or whether she will have her voice after a long period of
                intubation, and she speaks in complete sentences, and even counts and reads her first letters. She is
                extremely cheerful, smart and sociable. One could say – a normal child, though our lives will always be
                different from commonly understood normality. The reminder of this is not only the scar across her
                chest, hospital visits and medications that Nina takes several times a day, but also the fear for her
                life which is with us all the time.</p>
            <img src="assets/img/img_05.jpg" alt="">
            <p><span>Nina is still waiting for another planned operation – the Fontan surgery.</span> It will not fix
                her heart, but will allow her to continue to live and grow. We are closely observing the development of
                technology that could allow to stop the progression of Nina’s condition caused by different from
                physiological blood circulation, as well as to postpone or even avoid a heart transplant, which – if
                works – is not a solution to all problems. We know that we are very lucky that Nina is now well. Many
                of the children we met along the way have passed away. Unfortunately, we also know that with Nina's
                condition we will never experience a complete peace of mind and we will never be able to say “the worst
                is behind us”. Therefore, when it came to organising the last of Nina's planned surgeries – the Fontan
                operation – we decided to look for the most optimal solution to minimize the risk associated with such
                severe treatment. Hence our decision for the final stage of the surgical palliation to be held at the
                University Hospital in Münster with Professor. Edward Malec, who achieves great results in surgical
                treatment of HLHS. His results after the Fontan surgery are: 100% survival rate, short
                hospitalizations, minimum complications. The child does not have to reach precise body weight for the
                surgery which for Nina who is severely underweight is crucial. It all convinced us to make this
                decision. In Germany, we will be able to stay with our child 24 hours a day, also in the intensive care
                (ICU), which in Poland is still impossible. In our hospital in Poland, ICU visits are allowed only 2
                times a day and last for 45 minutes. It is very important to us to be with our daughter during the
                entire treatment process. Having had the experience of a long hospital stay and complicated
                postoperative course, it's difficult for us to imagine that after such a complex operation Nina will
                not be able to have her mom and dad at her side. Proffesor Malec has already agreed to perform Nina's
                surgery and we got officially accepted by the UKM to start the treatment.</p>
            <img src="assets/img/img_06.jpg" alt="">
            <p><span>The expected costs of the cardiac catheterization, the Fontan surgery and hospital stay amount to
                    37 000 Euro.</span> In case of any complications or other unforeseen illnesses, this budget will be
                recalculated in consideration of additional treatment performed. So in fact we might need more than
                that. We have already gathered around 1/3 of this amount thanks to your help. We hope that with your
                further support we will be able to finance our hospital stay in Münster.</p>
            <img src="assets/img/img_07.jpg" alt="">
            <p><span>We would like to thank for the continued support and the help so far.</span></p>
